## 1. Who We Are

**Lasagna** is an independent project created and maintained by an individual developer based in **Portugal (European Union)**. This is an offline-first, progressive web application (PWA) for calculating recipe costs, designed for small food businesses and home bakers.

We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency regarding how your data is handled.

You can contact us at: support@lasagnacost.com

---

## 2. What We Collect

We do **not collect or store personal data by default**. Your recipes, ingredient lists, prices, and calculations stay **only on your device**.

We **only receive data** if you voluntarily provide it:
- Via the support form on the website  
- Via error reports in the app (Sentry)

---

## 3. Support Requests

If you contact us through the support form, we may receive:
- Your email (if you provide it)  
- The content of your message  

This is used only to respond to your inquiry. We **do not share it with third parties** or use it for marketing.

---

## 4. Error Reports via Sentry

If you submit an error report or the app sends crash data, it may include:
- Browser and device information  
- Error messages and stack traces  
- Your email, **if you included it in the report**  

> Your recipes, ingredients, and prices are **never sent** to Sentry.

---

## 5. Google Analytics

We use **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** to understand how users interact with the app. GA collects **anonymous technical data**:
- Device type and OS  
- Browser language  
- Approximate location (city-level)  
- Session duration and behavior  

GA uses cookies (`_ga`, `_gid`). We **never share your recipes or costs**.

### Opting Out
- Reject analytics cookies via consent banner (if shown)  
- Disable cookies in your browser  
- Use the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout)

---

## 6. No Accounts Needed

You can use the app **without signing up**.  
We do **not ask for or store** usernames, emails, or passwords unless you provide them via support or error reporting.

---

## 7. Data Deletion

Local data: clear your browser storage/cache or uninstall the PWA.  

Support or error report data: contact us at **support@lasagnacost.com** to request deletion.

---

## 8. Your Rights Under GDPR

If you are in the EU, you can:
- Know what data is collected and why  
- Withdraw consent for analytics, support, or error reporting  
- Request access or deletion of personal data  

Most rights are fulfilled by design since we do **not collect data by default**.
