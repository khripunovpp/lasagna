## 1. Who We Are

**Lasanha** is an independent project created and maintained by an individual developer based in **Portugal (European Union)**. This is an offline-first, progressive web application (PWA) for calculating recipe costs, designed for small food businesses and home bakers.

We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency regarding how your data is handled.

You can contact us at: *[email address to be added]*

---

## 2. Data We Do **Not** Collect

We do **not collect or store any personal information**, such as your name, email address, phone number, or account data.

---

## 3. What You Input and Where It Stays

All the data you enter in the app — including ingredient lists, recipes, prices, and invoice calculations — is stored **locally on your device** (in your browser storage or device cache).  
We do **not** transmit or store this data on our servers.

---

## 4. Google Analytics

We use **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** to help us understand how users interact with the app and improve your experience. GA may collect anonymous technical data such as:
- Device type and operating system
- Browser language
- Approximate location (city-level)
- Session duration and behavior (e.g. which pages/screens were visited)

GA uses cookies such as:
- `_ga`: Stores a client identifier (expires in 2 years)
- `_gid`: Stores session information (expires in 24 hours)

> **We do not share any of your app data (like recipes or costs) with Google.**

### How to Opt Out
You can opt out by:
- Rejecting analytics cookies via the consent banner (if shown),
- Disabling cookies in your browser settings,
- Installing the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

---

## 5. Crash Reporting with Sentry

We use **Sentry** to detect and fix errors in the app.  
Crash reports may include technical details like:
- Browser and device type
- Application version
- Error messages and stack traces

> Sentry reports **do not contain any user-generated content** (e.g., your recipes, ingredients, or prices).

---

## 6. No User Accounts or Registration

You can use the app **without creating an account**.  
We do not ask for or store any usernames, emails, or login information.

---

## 7. Data Deletion

Since all your input is stored locally, **you have full control** over your data. You can delete your data by:
- Clearing browser storage and cache for the app,
- Uninstalling the PWA from your device.

---

## 8. Your Rights Under GDPR

If you are located in the EU, you have the right to:
- Know what data is collected and why,
- Withdraw consent (e.g. for analytics),
- Request access or deletion of any personal data (if ever applicable).

As we do not collect personal data, most of these rights are fulfilled by design.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated in the future, especially if we introduce features like cloud sync or premium plans.  
The date at the top will reflect the most recent version.

We recommend you check this page periodically.
