## üóÇÔ∏è Category Management

The **Categories** tab in the Settings section allows you to manage product and recipe categories. Categorization helps you organize items, filter data, and group similar content for better clarity and reporting.

### üì¶ Product Categories

Navigate to **Product Categories** to view and manage the list of all available product groups.

Each category is displayed in a list and includes:
- The category name (e.g., "Glazes and coatings", "Oils and fats", "Gluten-free ingredients")
- Actions:
  - ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit** ‚Äî rename the category
  - ‚ùå **Delete** ‚Äî permanently remove the category

To **add a new category**:
1. Click on **Add** next to the section title.
2. Enter a name in the input field.
3. Click **Save category** to confirm.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Deleting a category will not delete associated products, but those products will become uncategorized.

### üßæ Recipe Categories

Similarly, click on **Recipe Categories** to manage how your recipes are grouped:
- Create categories such as "Cakes", "Ganache", "Bases", "Decorations", etc.
- This improves sorting and structuring in large recipe collections.

Categorization is optional but strongly recommended for keeping your data structured and easy to search or export.
