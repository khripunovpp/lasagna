## 🧾 Invoice Settings

The **Invoice settings** tab lets you customize the appearance and formatting of generated invoices.

### 🖼️ Logo

- **Upload logo** — allows you to upload your custom logo that will be displayed on all exported PDF invoices.
- Recommended format: PNG with transparent background for best results.

### 🆔 Invoice Prefix

- The **Prefix for invoices** field lets you define a custom prefix that will be prepended to each invoice number.
- Examples:  
  - `UK-FR-` → results in `UK-FR-001`, `UK-FR-002`, etc.  
  - `2025-INV-` → useful for year-based or categorized numbering

> 📌 The prefix is only visual and does not affect the invoice’s internal ID.

### 🔢 Rounding Precision

The **Precision** section allows you to define how many decimal places are shown:

- **For rows** — number of decimal places for each invoice line item  
  _(e.g., 1.234 becomes 1.23 if precision = 2)_

- **For totals** — number of decimal places for the total amount  
  _(2 is recommended for currency-based values)_

> These settings affect display only — the internal calculations maintain full precision.

These settings allow you to tailor invoice formatting to match your brand and bookkeeping preferences.
