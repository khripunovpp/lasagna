## 🧾 Invoice Credentials

The **Credentials** tab allows you to define the sender and recipient details that will appear on generated invoices.

This section is divided into two subtabs:
- **System** – your own business details (used as the sender)
- **Customer** – predefined recipient data (coming soon)

### 🧷 System Credentials

These fields are used to populate the sender block of each invoice. They are especially useful for legal, accounting, and tax purposes.

> You can define multiple credentials if needed (e.g., for different legal entities, languages, or brands).

#### Fields (labels coming soon):

Although labels are not yet displayed in the UI, the input fields represent the following information (from left to right, top to bottom):

1. **Tax Identification Number** – e.g., VAT number or national tax number  
2. **Country** – your legal country of registration  
3. **Phone number** – for contact or support purposes  
4. **Company name** – or your personal name as a freelancer  
5. **Address** – your business or billing address  
6. **Email** – for invoice replies or legal notices

### ➕ Actions

- **Add row** – create additional credential sets (e.g., for other branches or brands)
- **No changes** – indicator that there are no unsaved edits
- ❌ Red cross – remove the selected credential block

> All entered information will be automatically inserted into every invoice PDF you generate.
