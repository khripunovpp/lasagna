## 🌐 Language Settings

The **Localization** section in the Settings page allows you to configure the interface language and default currency for the application.

### 🗣️ Interface Language

You can choose one of the available interface languages:

- 🇵🇹 **Português** — Portuguese  
- 🇷🇺 **Русский** — Russian  
- 🇬🇧 **English** — English

The selected language is stored locally and applied across the entire application.  
Once selected, the interface updates automatically — no page reload is required.

> ❗ Only **one language** can be active at a time.

### 💱 Currency

The `Currency` field accepts codes in the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format.  
Examples include:
- `EUR` — Euro  
- `USD` — US Dollar  
- `RUB` — Russian Ruble  

The selected currency is used throughout the app:
- in recipe cost calculations
- on generated invoices
- in all displayed financial values
