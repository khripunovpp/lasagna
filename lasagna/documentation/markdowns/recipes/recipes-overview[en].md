# 📖 Recipes

A recipe is the core data structure in the system. It consists of one or more products or sub-recipes, along with their quantities, units, and optional descriptions.  
Recipes allow you to calculate precise costs, define composition, and include them in invoices.

## 🧭 The Recipes Page

This page displays your full list of saved and draft recipes.

### 🗂️ Grouping

By default, recipes are **grouped by category**, which you assign manually. You can also change the grouping method:

- `By category` (default)
- `By tag`
- `By creation date`
- `By first letter`

### 🔄 Grouping Direction

Each group can be sorted in different directions:

- `From A to Z` (alphabetically or from old to new)
- `From Z to A` (reverse order)

### 🔠 Inside Groups

Within each group, recipes are **automatically sorted alphabetically**.

## ✏️ Drafts

If you modify a recipe but haven’t saved it fully, it appears as a **draft** and is visually marked.  
You’ll also see a banner at the top showing the number of unsaved drafts.

## ✅ Selection & Bulk Actions

- Click a recipe card to enter **selection mode**
- Once selected, you can:
  - Delete multiple recipes at once
  - Export selected recipes

## 🔁 Import & Export

In the bottom right corner you’ll find two buttons:

- **Export recipes** — download your recipes to a file
- **Import products** — upload products to use in recipes

> Import/export is useful for transferring data between devices or using templates.

This section is the heart of the system. Here you combine ingredients, structure your ideas, and calculate the true cost of your creations.
