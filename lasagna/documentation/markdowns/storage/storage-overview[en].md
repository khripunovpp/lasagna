# 🧺 Stock (Products Page)

The **Stock** section is where you manage all ingredients and materials used in your recipes.  
Each item on this page is called a **product**, and it has a price, unit, category, and edit history.

## 🗃️ Page Structure

- Products are automatically **grouped by categories**.
- Items **without a category** appear at the top.
- Each product displays the **last edited** timestamp in the top-right corner.

## 📝 Drafts

If you made changes to a product but didn’t save them, a message will appear at the top indicating **unsaved changes**.  
Click the message to view or review your draft edits.

## ✅ Selection Mode & Bulk Actions

Clicking on a product activates **selection mode**:

- You can select multiple products at once.
- After selection, bulk actions become available:
  - **Delete** selected products
  - **Export** selected products to a file

Available selection tools:
- `Select all`
- `Hide selection`
- `Clear selection from all`

## 🔁 Import & Export

At the bottom right of the screen, you'll find two key options:

- **Export products** — saves your product list to a file (for backup or transfer)
- **Import products** — uploads a file with product data (in a compatible format)

> Importing will add new products and update existing ones if their IDs match.

## 📌 Sorting and Display

- Products are **always sorted by category**, and within each category by **last edited date**.
- The interface is optimized for speed and clarity, helping you quickly locate ingredients and keep data up to date.
