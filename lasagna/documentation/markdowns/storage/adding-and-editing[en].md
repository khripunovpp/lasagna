# ✏️ Creating and Editing a Product

This page lets you create a new product or edit an existing one.  
Products are used in recipes and invoices, so it’s important to set the correct price, weight, and category.

## 🧾 Fields and Elements

### 🧠 Product Name

- The top text field is for the **product name** (e.g., "Sugar", "Vanilla", "Flour T65").

### ⚖️ Weight and Price

- On the left: enter the **amount or weight** (e.g., 1 gram or 1 piece).
- On the right: enter the **price for the specified amount** in your base currency (e.g., `0.023 €`).
- You can switch between units: `g` or `pcs` (default is grams).
- Clicking the **➕ icon** opens a **calculation widget**:
  - For example: a widget to calculate the weight of eggs based on count and size.

### 🏷️ Category

- Choose a category that fits the product (e.g., "Dairy", "Flavors and Spices").
- Categories are managed in the Settings section and make it easier to organize and search.

### 🛒 Source

- Optionally, enter the source — store, website, or supplier where you usually buy this product.

## ⚡ Quick Tags (Chips)

- Below the Source field, you’ll see **quick tags** — the 5 most recently used sources.
- Click a chip to instantly fill the Source field with that value.

## 💾 Saving

- The **Save Changes** button saves your product:
  - Either creates a new one
  - Or updates an existing entry if you're editing it

> ❗ If you leave the page without saving, your changes are kept as a draft — but it’s better to save manually.
