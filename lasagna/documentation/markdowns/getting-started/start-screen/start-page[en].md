# 🏠 Home Page

After launching the app, you land on the **Home Page** — your starting screen and the main entry point to all key features.

## What's on this page:

- In the center, you'll see blocks titled **"Last edited recipes"** and **"Last edited products"**. These give you quick access to the items you've recently worked on.
- Each entry displays the item’s name and the time it was last modified. Clicking an item opens it for editing.

## Top Navigation Bar (Header):

The navigation menu is located at the top of the screen and includes:

- **Home** — return to the main dashboard.
- **Recipes** — navigate to the full list of recipes.
- **Products** — browse all saved products.
- **Invoices** — view and manage invoices.
- **Settings** — adjust preferences, view policies, and manage personal data.
- **More** — access additional actions like sync or export.
