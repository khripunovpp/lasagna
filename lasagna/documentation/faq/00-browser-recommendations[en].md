:::accordion Which browser should I use?
For the best experience, we recommend modern browsers: Google Chrome (88+), Mozilla Firefox (85+), Safari (14+), Microsoft Edge (88+), or Opera (74+). These browsers fully support all app features.
:::

:::accordion Why is it important to keep my browser updated?
New browser versions include performance improvements, security updates, and support for modern web technologies. This ensures more stable and faster app performance.
:::

:::accordion What if my browser is outdated?
Update your browser to the latest version. If that's not possible, try another modern browser. The app may work on older versions, but some features might be unavailable.
:::

:::accordion Are mobile browsers supported?
Yes, the app works excellently in mobile browsers: Safari on iOS (14+), Chrome on Android (88+), Samsung Internet (13+), and other modern mobile browsers.
:::

:::accordion Can I use the app in private/incognito mode?
Yes, but note that in private mode, data may not persist between sessions. For full functionality, we recommend using normal browser mode.
:::

:::accordion ‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful when clearing browser cache!
**Be careful** when clearing your browser cache! If you choose "Clear everything" (advanced, "all site data") or "Cookies and other site data" options, this will delete all your app data, including recipes, products, and settings. IndexedDB (where your data is stored) gets deleted along with cookies and site data. For safe cache clearing, use only "Cached images and files" option - this won't affect your data.
