title: üì∂ Offline & Installation
---

:::accordion Do I need an internet connection to use the app?
No. The app works fully offline. Internet is only needed for updates, optional sync, or cloud storage.
:::

:::accordion What does it mean to ‚Äúinstall as an app‚Äù?
It means you're using a PWA ‚Äî a Progressive Web App. It's installed directly from the site, runs like a native app, launches from your menu or home screen, and doesn't require an app store.
:::

:::accordion Are there any technical differences from native apps?
Minor differences mostly relate to background processes and system integration. For recipes and invoices, the experience is the same.
:::

:::accordion What happens if I lose internet while using the app?
Nothing ‚Äî the app continues working. It's built offline-first, so all functions remain available.
:::

:::accordion Why is the app so fast?
Because everything is processed locally on your device. No network delays.
