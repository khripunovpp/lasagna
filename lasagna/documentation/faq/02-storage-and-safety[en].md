:::accordion Where is my data stored?
Your data is stored locally on your device. If installed as a standalone app, data is kept with it â€” no server involved.
:::

:::accordion Will my data be lost if I clear browser data?
If used in-browser, clearing cache or history may remove data. Installed apps store data separately.
:::

:::accordion What happens if I uninstall the app?
Like any other app, uninstalling removes its local data. We recommend enabling sync or exporting backups.
:::

:::accordion Is the app safe to use?
Yes. It runs locally and doesnâ€™t send anything to servers unless you choose to sync.
:::

:::accordion Who can access my data?
Only you. Sync is encrypted and optional. Nothing is uploaded without your consent.
