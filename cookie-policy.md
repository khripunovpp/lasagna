## 1. What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored on your device by your browser when you visit websites. They are widely used to enable functionality, improve performance, and collect analytics to help us understand how users interact with our product.

In this policy, we also include similar technologies like **LocalStorage**, **SessionStorage**, and **third-party SDKs** that store data on your device.

## 2. Do We Use Cookies?

Yes â€” Lasagna uses cookies and local storage technologies for the following purposes:

- **Strictly Necessary Cookies**: ensure basic functionality and user preferences (e.g. cookie consent itself).
- **Analytics Cookies**: help us understand user behavior through tools like **Google Analytics**.
- **Crash Reporting Cookies**: used by **Sentry** to detect and fix technical issues.
- **Performance & Media Delivery (future)**: CDN services may be used in the future to deliver images or media files efficiently.

No cookies will be set **unless you have explicitly consented**, except those strictly required for the app to function.
